# TOP-calculator

This is my last project for _The Odin Project_ foundations path!

At first i believed it would be _*very*_ hard, but thanks to my understanding of discrete mathematics i was able to solve it quite easily by treating the mathematical expressions as binary trees!

There are some obvious improvements to be made:
    - Add a backspace key
    - Keep last calculation on memory
    - Add keyboard support
    - Add css rules for mobile
    - Limit the amount of decimals for the result

And some harder ones:
    - add support for parenthesis
    - add power and root operations
    - add sin and cos functions
